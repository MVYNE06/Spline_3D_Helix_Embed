# Spline_3D_Helix_Embed
A minimal, responsive web embed for showcasing an interactive 3D DNA double helix model created in Spline. Ideal for bioscience portfolios and web presentations.

🧬 Interactive 3D DNA Helix Web Showcase

This is a simple, single-file HTML project to demonstrate how easily you can embed and beautifully present an interactive 3D model (specifically a DNA double helix) on the web using the Spline platform.

I built this specifically for a quick portfolio showcase on platforms like LinkedIn—it’s clean, responsive, and keeps the focus entirely on the interactive asset.
